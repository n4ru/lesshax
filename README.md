**lesshax** is a 3DS 9.0/9.2 payload based on smealum's ninjhax 2.x that has been modified specifically to boot into Custom Firmware such as rxTools, ReiNAND, or CakesFW. It was designed with three goals in mind:

  - Boot Faster
  - Boot Consistently
  - Boot Silently

Regular payloads are centered around homebrew and created for things like HBL and other projects, as well as tailored for a wide range of firmware. As such, they include homebrew tailored code that users of backups booting from 9.0/9.2 into emuNAND official firmware rarely use. As a side effect, they have some serious issues booting custom firmware, even through tools like CtrBootManager. **lesshax** is meant to solve that issue by increasing boot speeds, silencing the debug information, and getting you to your Home Menu as often as possible.

### Features

 - **ninjhax 2.1 base** optimized for 9.0 & 9.2.
 - **Stability** patches.
 - **fs:USER, ns:s, and APT + am:sys modules** for homebrew.
 - **\>90% bootrate** over 100 boot tests.
 - **No debug** text or flashing screens.
 - **Increased boot speeds**.

### Installation

Replace your existing ninjhax 2.x payload with the appropriate **lesshax** version. **lesshax will boot into less.3dsx, NOT boot.3dsx! Rename your boot manager accordingly!**


### Homebrew
While 99% of Homebrew will function properly, if you need to run a specific application that doesn't seem to function as intended, install the Homebrew Launcher as a CIA and it will launch through the official ninjhax 2.5 payload! This way you lose ZERO compatibility. Because lesshax boots into less.3dsx instead of boot.3dsx, you can keep your homebrew launcher file named boot.3dsx and have it continue to launch properly!

### Building
The repo contains the majority of what you need to build the payload, aside from the following:

* **[python 2.7]**
* **[devkitARM]** - Download and `export DEVKITARM=<pathto>/devkitARM`
* **[blowfish_processed.bin]** - place into `scripts` folder.

Once you're set, simply run `build.sh` and you should get twelve binaries in the `payloads` folder for the following configurations:
 - o3DS / n3DS
 - 9.0 / 9.2
 - USA / EUR / JPN
